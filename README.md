# Model a Problem Domain - Car Race

Each race involves a driver that controls a car, that has a top speed and acceleration. The Drivers race the cars around a track with a set distance for a set number of laps. The speed and acceleration of the car determine the ammount of time to go around the track one time, the number of laps determines how many times the cars must go around. And when the number of laps is complete, the car to finish first is the winner and all other cars are losers.
